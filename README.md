# Social-Welfare-HackOverflow

This is a Social Welfare Website create during the HackOverflow Hackathon. We tried to solve the social problems online. In this website one can upload there problems, where the most upvoted problem gets resolved first. We have also added some features like Adding events , news , updates , group-chat etc. We would further work on this project to make it better and easy to use. We are also looking to make the android version of the web application.

Some of the images of the projects are:
